# JPanel-intro
You are going to modify the code in the paintComponent() method for this project.
First, make the red X change to a plus sign in a different color.
Use the width and height variables, not numbers.
Your plus sign divides the screen into 4 quadrants.
Second, go to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html
and look at the drawOval(), fillOval(), drawRect() and fillRect() methods.
Use them to draw:
  an empty elipse in the first quadrant
  a solid elipse in the second quadrant
  an empty rectangle in the third quadrant
  a solid rectangle in the fourth quadrant.
The x and y parameters must use the width and height variables.
All of the shapes should be different colors.
